        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;" >Dear Nature</h3>
    <p style="line-height:2em;">
        We didn’t always love you the way we do now.
        In fact, until now, we didn’t even realize how intrinsically we were connected to you. <br><br>
        We didn’t know that our every action affects you. But then we were awakened, 
        and we fell so deeply in love with you that others called us crazy. And our love for you 
        transformed every aspect of ourselves—how we operate, how we make decisions—even our purpose. <br><br>
        After all, how can a business be successful if it is harming you, the source of our life support system?Nature, do you remember the first time we came seeking your inspiration? We put aside our brash belief that we could solve every problem by ourselves, and we asked for your guidance. Admiring the beautiful and chaotic floors of your forests and meadows, we let go of our strive for perfection, our desire to control our creativity and we embraced the untapped power of diversity. The world loves your innovative solutions too.
